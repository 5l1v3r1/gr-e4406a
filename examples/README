*** GRC flowgraphs examples ***

* test.grc: 
very basic flowgraph that demonstrates a 4096 point capture each second (no stress!)

* remote.grc: 
simple remote center frequency control of the E4406A

* qpsk.grc:
QPSK constellation visualization using QT GUI using the plain E4406A source block.
Because of choppiness in the samples flow it can be difficult to visualize constellation 
when data is random.

* qpsk2_wx.grc:
Uses E4406A buffered source with WX GUI. It retains QT GUI blocks as disabled blocks
so it can be easily reverted to QT GUI. Allows to visualize better constellations 
modulated with random data.

* qpsk3.grc:
Uses the double buffered pacer to give smoother experience! Uses QT GUI with QX GUI
blocks disabled. It gives a real time feeling.
