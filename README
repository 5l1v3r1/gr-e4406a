This is a GNURadio module to get complex samples from an Agilent E4406A VSA

You need the libvxi11 library to be installed in your system. See:
https://github.com/f4exb/libvxi11

The Gnu Radio block requires a recent gnuradio (>= v3.7) to be installed.

Before building the block you have to make sure that all the dependencies
(see list of supported devices above) you are intend to work with are
properly installed. The build system of gr-osmosdr will recognize them and
enable specific source/sink components thereafter.

Please note: prior pulling a new version from git and compiling it,
please do a "make uninstall" first to properly remove the previous version.

Building with cmake:

git clone https://github.com/f4exb/gr-e4406a
cd gr-e4406a
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

See INSTALL for a more exotic cmake command involving custom locations for libvxi11 and GNURadio
