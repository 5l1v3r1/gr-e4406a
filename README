This is a GNURadio module to get complex samples from an Agilent E4406A VSA

You need the libvxi11 library to be installed in your system. See:
https://github.com/f4exb/libvxi11

The Gnu Radio block requires a recent gnuradio (>= v3.7) to be installed.

Please note: prior pulling a new version from git and compiling it,
please do a "make uninstall" first to properly remove the previous version.

Building with cmake:

git clone https://github.com/f4exb/gr-e4406a
cd gr-e4406a
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

See INSTALL for a more exotic cmake command involving custom locations for 
libvxi11 and GNURadio. You do not need to install with sudo if this is in a 
location your user has access (this is my preferred solution).
