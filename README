This is a GNURadio module to get complex samples from an Agilent E4406A VSA

You need the libvxi11 library to be installed in your system. See:
https://github.com/f4exb/libvxi11

The GNURadio block requires a recent gnuradio (>= v3.7) to be installed.

Please note: prior pulling a new version from git and compiling it,
please do a "make uninstall" first to properly remove the previous version.

Building with cmake:

git clone https://github.com/f4exb/gr-e4406a
cd gr-e4406a
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

See INSTALL for a more exotic cmake command involving custom locations for 
libvxi11 and GNURadio. You do not need to install with sudo if this is in a 
location your user has access to (this is my preferred solution). 

GNURadio blocks implemented (by GRC name):

* E4406A source:
Basic control and I/Q samples retrieval from an Agilent E4406A VSA over the 
LAN using VXI-11 protocol. 

* E4406A Remote Control
Simple remote control of the E4406A mainly just to fine tune center frequency
which is impossible with instrument's knob. It is a dummy source block that
just output zeroes. Just connect it to a throttle block and a null sink block.

See examples/README for information on the examples.
